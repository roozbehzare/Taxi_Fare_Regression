# Taxi Fare Prediction

This repository contains a **machine learning project** designed to predict **taxi fares**. The purpose of the project is to provide an estimate of the fare a passenger would pay for a taxi ride based on input data such as distance, time, and location.

## ⚠️ Important Note
Currently, this project is **not running** due to limitations with my computer. However, the code and structure are included, and if you have a more powerful system, you are welcome to clone this repository and try running it yourself.

## 🚀 Future Work
- Running and testing the models fully  
- Improving prediction accuracy  
- Adding results and visualizations  

## 📌 Status
This is a **work in progress**. I plan to update and improve it in the future when I have access to more resources.

## 🙌 Contributions
Suggestions, feedback, and pull requests are welcome!  
If you are interested in **machine learning or data analysis**, feel free to explore and contribute.
