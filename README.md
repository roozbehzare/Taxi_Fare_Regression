# Taxi_Fare_Regression
This repository contains a machine learning project designed to predict taxi fares. The purpose of the project is to provide an estimate of the fare a passenger would pay for a taxi ride based on input data such as distance, time, and location.  At this stage, the project is not running due to limitations with my computer.
